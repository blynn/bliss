    Plugins: instead of machine_info struct, now provide machine_info_init
    function. More flexible, and easier to debug.

    Added machine->tick(): this is called at the end of every row in a pattern.
    Handy for porting buzz machines.

    Added screenshot function.

    bugfix: was using pattern->id before it was initialized
    during machine_pattern_new_auto_id()

    [bliss-0.01.tgz]

Sat Mar 22 11:39:32 PST 2003
    bugfix: new_pattern_name: wasn't cloning string.

Fri Mar 21 20:53:21 PST 2003
    Added window widgets, very kludgy but they appear to work.

    Added about window, filename textbox window.

    Cleaned up mlist.c, pl.c, so that pl.c is barebones platform-dependent
    code, while mlist is higher-level list of machine info.

    New machine brings up list of available machines.

    Implemented rename. Just realized the machine names don't have to be
    unique, which means I shouldn't have called them ID's, and additionally
    I'll have to change the file format (edges and master selector).

    Wavedata save/loads correctly. (Uses base64.)

    Added menuitem highlight.

    Spreadsheet editing is much better.

    Code cleanup: moved audio code and root window code out of main.c

    Not sure how much to rely on signals, and how much to rely on builtin
    function pointers. (e.g. for moving/resizing?) I'll experiment with
    resize events = signal. I could change update, move, etc. as well,
    perhaps even the event handler.

    Can handle window resizes now.

    Plays bass track of demo.

    Now old problems are coming back to haunt me. The trouble with the
    column-independent way of doing things is that it makes it tricky to do
    several tracks. Last time I had a "t" command for track select.
    MIDI doesn't have this problem because a particular note is either playing
    or not playing (unlike trackers, where the same note can play against
    itself).

    This time, I'll won't have the t command. Instead, I'll use the column
    number of the spreadsheet to determine the action.

    All this parsing code is annoying. Perhaps it should be done as soon
    as it is entered in the spreadsheet.

    Rudimentary tracker works (no effects yet).

    Basic textbox works.

Thu Mar 20 12:36:18 PST 2003
    Bugfix: forgot that pattern data contains 0's, which means no ASCIIZ.

    Save/load works.

    Found bug in read_word, read_dword: problem with << on char which is
    signed (fixed by using unsigned char).

    Buzz conversion prorgessing well.

Wed Mar 19 18:37:57 PST 2003
    Fixed stupid bug in blbass2.c, sine.c: I had swapped two lines so
    variable declarations were before statements, but then I forgot to
    move the malloc.

Wed Mar 19 14:34:03 PST 2003
    Added New Song, Save Song, Load Song menu items, started work on
    save/load routines. Have to think about how to handle plugin filenames.

Wed Mar 19 00:19:25 PST 2003
    Functional (but practically unusable): can edit patterns and tracks
    such that sine wave changes frequency during playback.
    
    Fixed z-ordering problem (it was affecting machine orders globally;
    need to create separate z-order list).

    Added buttons, program is more usable now.

    Started work on buzz conversion code.

Tue Mar 18 00:57:11 PST 2003
    Having trouble with include files depending on each other.
    Will think about this later.

    Coded grid widget, used by pattern window and song window.

    Added tracks, can edit patterns/tracks, but still not quite enough
    for a complete song.

    First version of pattern will use linked lists.

Mon Mar 17 14:03:50 PST 2003
    Spreadsheet coming along nicely.

    Added Action menu. Draws edges, with arrow in a circle.

Mon Mar 17 01:32:18 PST 2003
    Can delete machines via popup menu accessed with RMB.

    Started pattern windows.

    Modified SDL_gfx header file: DLLINTERFACE has to be empty otherwise
    it won't compile for Windows.

    Wrote winpl.? so it compiles for Windows now. Binary untested.

    Lost old NEWS file and machine.c due to LUFS bug (I think) :(
    Could be worse: only lost about 10mins work.
    (I had stopped working on this and only restarted a few days ago.)
    Since last entry: added (messy) GUI code.

    Copied SDL_gfx code into directory.

    Can connect machines.

    Old code looks crufty. fillcount variable seems unnecessary,
    clearing buf_ready should not require an additional test.

    Removed audio buffer, and it seems to work better in general,
    though now underruns occur when the program window just loses focus
    for example. Might introduce thread for GUI stuff, and have a separate
    sound buffering thread.

Wed Jan 22 08:25:27 PST 2003
    Experimented with dlopen et al. Seems pretty easy to use. Makefile will
    need changing though.

Tue Jan 21 02:43:59 PST 2003
    Slow progress. Can drag machines on screen.

Thu Jan  9 03:06:03 PST 2003
    Restarted (again) in C, because previous attempt seemed too slow.

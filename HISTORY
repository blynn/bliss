    Decided old project was getting too messy, and my approach to the problem
    was wrong. My new way: instead of having an unusable system until the
    end, I'll have it so that the program is usable (but simple) as soon as
    possible, and build on it. Copied many files from old project.

    Also, emulating Buzz's restrictions is hard, I've decided to enact a few
    changes:

	- instead of rigid tracks and patterns, I'll have it more like MIDI:
	at a cetain time, a certain event occurs. I'll keep the granularity
	low for now though.

	- events could be quite complex in nature; the song is an event itself,
	that way it could contain more songs.

	- instead of hex values, inputs will be strings. It's up to the machine
	how to interpret strings. This is so the song can be edited with a
	text editor, which seems like a fun idea.

    First step: a simple drum machine.

    Making songs, patterns look like spreadsheets for easy editing. Also
    more flexible.

    Rudimentary editor works.

    Can save files. (Can't load them yet though!)

    Split edior code into PATTERN_WINDOW class. Started MACHINE_WINDOW: can
    move boxes around with mouse now.

    Cleaned up external.c pixel drawing code.

    Added (slow) line drawing routine.

    Decided to use SDL_gfx graphics primitives instead, rather than reinventing
    yet another wheel.

    Merged MACHINE_PICTURE into MACHINE.

    Can connect machines.

    Draws those little arrows in connections.

    Added pattern_table to MACHINE, moved machine_table to SONG class, along
    with other stuff.

    Still seems messy. Not sure how do deal with machine_zorder stuff.
    Have select_machine, and select_machine_and_raise functions in SONG?

    Changed SONG so it's more like Buzz songs. I'll consider putting in
    a more generalized version in later. And call it a SEQUENCE instead,
    so that SONG's can be made of several SEQUENCE's.

    Removed extraneous add_last's in place_selection, process_key in
    MACHINE_WINDOW.

    Added song window.

Thu Mar  7 11:12:25 PST 2002
    Started Buzz file loader.

    Draws current line of song playing in song and pattern windows.

    Should machine window be a viewport? 

    Started Buzz importer code.

    Some classes getting to big and unwieldy.

    Need to rename: `track' --> `sequence'

    Need to rename: tick --> ???, boom --> tick

    Converts notes of Bass 2. Can play, but it sounds bad.

    Is double just as fast as float? I don't need all that precision.

    Renamed tick to next_sample.

    Intend to call project Bliss. At first it'll stand for
    Ben Lynn's Idiotic/Inadequate Soft-Synth, but eventually the "I" will
    stand for "Incredible". :)

    Addded fade in/out to Bass 2, volume, note length. Much better now.

    Fixed empty song in song_window bug.

    Tracker conversion working.

    Connection stuff should be renamed to graph theory terms.

    Added import buzz file window at last. Window managing code needed now.

    [bliss-0.1.tgz]

    Added BLDelay, simplified code for simple machines.

Mon Mar 11 02:20:16 PST 2002
    Been reading up on DSP.

    BLBass2 can do LPF now, but not sure if it's correct. The sample code
    at <http://www.harmony-central.com/Computer/Programming/resonant-lp-filter.c>
    Why doesn't it use history of previous inputs?

    Resonance kind of works. Need to find out how envelope works.

    Made drawing edges more efficient. Fixed edge drawing bug in MACHINE_WINDOW
    (vertical problems).

    Tweaked SDL calls so it works on rooster.

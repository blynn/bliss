Bliss 0.1.3

Ben Lynn

INSTALLATION

The SDL library is required.

Type "make" to compile. For Windows binaries, type "make OS=win32",
though the Makefile will most likely need to be edited first so it can
find the location of the Windows SDL files.

DEMOS

stomper.bl
    Stomper Hyperion (http://www.master-zap.com/) comes with some demo sounds.
    I ported a few of them to Bliss.

demo.bl
    Uses a very simple instrument. The track has a line from "Armani Showers",
    a sample tune distributed with ScreamTracker.

shepard.bl
    Produces an acoustical illusion. The scale that seems to go up an octave
    but it has actually ended up where it started.

pluck.bl
    Uses the Karplus-Strong algorithm to sound like a plucked string.

dist.bl
    A distorted plucked string with echo. Sounds a bit like an electric guitar.
    Shows how effects can be used at the instrument level.

CONFIGURATION

bliss can be configured using the file "config.txt". There is only one
option at the moment:

latency <n>
    Open the audio driver with latency n. n should be a power of 2. The
    larger n is, the larger the delay between input and audio output,
    but if n is too small, audio dropouts become frequent (especially
    on Windows)

NOTES

MIDI input under Windows isn't supported yet.

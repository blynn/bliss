Bliss 0.1.1

INSTALLATION

The SDL library is required.

Type "make" to compile. For Windows binaries, type "make OS=win32",
though the Makefile will most likely need to be edited first so it can
find the location of the Windows SDL files.

DEMOS

stomper.bl
    Stomper Hyperion (http://www.master-zap.com/) comes with some demo sounds.
    I ported a few of them to Bliss. The track has a simple
    drum pattern.

demo.bl
    Uses a very simple instrument. The track has a line from "Armani Showers",
    a sample tune distributed with ScreamTracker.

shepard.bl
    Produces an acoustical illusion. The scale that seems to go up an octave
    but it has actually ended up where it started.

NOTES

MIDI input under Windows isn't supported yet.
